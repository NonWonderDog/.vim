Vim Configuration Files
=======================

This relies in the behavior introduced in Vim 7.3, in which ~/.vim/vimrc is 
a default alternate location for ~/.vimrc. This works only on Linux and maybe 
OSX.

On Windows, this must be installed to %USERPROFILE%/.vim, and the 
win\_install.bat script must be run to create a %USERPROFILE%/.vimrc stub file.

To create a file or folder named ".vim" in Windows Explorer, type ".vim.". The 
trailing period will be removed.
